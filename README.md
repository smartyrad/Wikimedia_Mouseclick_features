# Wikimedia_Mouseclick_features
THe jupyter notebook in this repository contains the code for extracting the mouse click features from https://github.com/balabit/Mouse-Dynamics-Challenge 

The features exracted are hopefully useful in differentiating between bots and humans in real-life scenarios as well.
For example: Simple bots will have a high efficiency whereas the efficieny of the average human is much lesser. 

I have used the user 16 session files to generate the data. 
For this task, I tried to implement the features denoted in the research papers given below.
